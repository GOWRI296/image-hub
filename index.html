                Cinematic describes anything related to cinema.
                 It may refer to: any movie updates, cinema nights,
                 cinematic review
                 <br>
                 Cinematographers use a lens to focus reflected light
                 from objects into a real image that is transferredto
                 some image sensor or light-sensitive material inside
                  the movie camera.

                 These exposures are created sequentially and preserveds for later processing and
                 viewing as a motion picture.
                 Capturing images with an electronic image sensor produces an electrical charge for
                 each pixel in the image,
                 which is electronically processed and stored in a video file for subsequent processing
                 or display.
                 Images captured with photographic emulsion result in a series of invisible latent
                 images on the film stock, which are chemically "developed" into a visible image. 
                 The images on the film stock are projected for viewing in the same motion picture.</div>

                <p>
                    In the 1830s, three different solutions for moving images were invented based on
                     the concept of revolving drums and disks, the stroboscope by Simon von Stampfer in Austria, the phenakistoscope by Joseph Plateau in Belgium, and the zoetrope by William Horner in Britain.

In 1845, Francis Ronalds invented the first successful camera able to make continuous recordings of
 the varying indications of meteorological and geomagnetic instruments over time. The cameras were supplied to numerous observatories around the world and some remained in use until well into the 20th century.[2][3][4]

William Lincoln patented a device, in 1867 that showed animated pictures called the "wheel of life"
 or "zoopraxiscope". In it moving drawings or photographs were watched through a slit.

On 19 June 1878, Eadweard Muybridge successfully photographed a horse named "Sallie Gardner"
 in fast motion using a series of 24 stereoscopic cameras. The cameras were arranged along a track parallel to the horse's, and each camera shutter was controlled by a trip wire triggered by the horse's hooves. They were 21 inches apart to cover the 20 feet taken by the horse stride, taking pictures at one-thousandth of a second.[5] At the end of the decade, Muybridge had adapted sequences of his photographs to a zoopraxiscope for short, primitive projected "movies," which were sensations on his lecture tours by 1879 or 1880.

Four years later, in 1882, French scientist Étienne-Jules Marey invented a chronophotographic
 gun, which was capable of taking 12 consecutive frames a second and recording all the frames of the same picture.

The late nineteenth to the early twentieth centuries brought rise to the use of film not only for
 entertainment purposes but for scientific exploration as well. French biologist and filmmaker Jean Painleve lobbied heavily for the use of film in the scientific field, as the new medium was more efficient in capturing and documenting the behavior, movement, and environment of microorganisms, cells, and bacteria, than the naked eye.[6] The introduction of film into scientific fields allowed for not only the viewing of "new images and objects, such as cells and natural objects, but also the viewing of them in real time",[6] whereas prior to the invention of moving pictures, scientists and doctors alike had to rely on hand-drawn sketches of human anatomy and its microorganisms. This posed a great inconvenience in the scientific and medical worlds. The development of film and increased usage of cameras allowed doctors and scientists to grasp a better understanding and knowledge of their projects.[citation needed]

The origin of today's cinema is thanks to the Lumiere brothers, Auguste and Louis, who in 1895
 developed a machine called the Cinematographe, which had the ability to capture and show moving images. The early era of cinema saw rapid innovation. Filmmakers discover and apply new methods such as editing, special effects, close ups, etc. Hollywood began to emerge as the mecha of the film industry, and many of the famous studios today such as Warner Bros and Paramount Pictures began to rule the film world. Overtime, cinema and cinematography have changed drastically. From the silent films of the early 20th century, to the ability of sound to be added to films in the 1920s, widescreen and color films in the 50s, huge improvements in general creativity and methodology have emerged.

                      The experimental film Roundhay Garden Scene, filmed by
                       Louis Le Prince on October 14, 1888 in Roundhay,
                      Leeds, England, is the earliest surviving motion
                       picture This movie was shot on paper film.[8]

  An experimental film camera was developed by British inventor William Friese
  Greene and patented in 1889.[9] W. K. L. Dickson,
  working under the direction of Thomas Alva Edison, was the first to
  design a successful apparatus, the Kinetograph,[10] patented in 1891.[11]
  This camera took a series of instantaneous photographs on standard
  Eastman Kodak photographic emulsion coated onto a transparent celluloid strip 35 mm wide.
  The results of this work were first shown in public in 1893, 
  using the viewing apparatus also designed by Dickson, the Kinetoscope.
  Contained within a large box, only one person at a time looking into it through a peephole could view the movie.

  In the following year, Charles Francis Jenkins and his projector, the Phantoscope,[12] made a successful audience
  viewing while Louis and Auguste Lumière perfected the Cinématographe, an apparatus that took, printed, and projected film, in Paris in December 1895.[13]
  The Lumière brothers were the first to present projected, moving, photographic, pictures to a paying audience of more than one person.

In 1896, movie theaters were open in France (Paris, Lyon, Bordeaux, Nice, Marseille); Italy (Rome, Milan, Naples, Genoa, Venice, Bologna, Forlì);
Brussels; and London.
The chronological improvements in the medium may be listed concisely.
In 1896, Edison showed his improved Vitascope projector, the first commercially successful projector in the U.S. Cooper Hewitt invented mercury lamps
which made it practical to shoot films indoors without sunlight in 1905. The first animated cartoon was produced in 1906. 
Credits began to appear at the beginning of motion pictures in 1911. The Bell and Howell 2709 movie camera invented in 1915 allowed directors to make
close-ups without physically moving the camera.
By the late 1920s, most of the movies produced were sound films. Wide screen formats were first experimented within the 1950s. 
By the 1970s, most movies were color films. IMAX and other 70mm formats gained popularity. Wide distribution of films became commonplace, setting the ground for "blockbusters." 
Film cinematography dominated the motion picture industry from its inception until the 2010s when digital cinematography became dominant. 
Film cinematography is still used by some directors, especially in specific applications or out of fondness for the format.
